<h4>LAST UPDATED: May 10, 2012</h4>

<p>One Mind (the “Organization," "we," "us") is concerned about online privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through the Internet website currently located at <a href="privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">https://portal.onemind.org/terms/privacy-policy</a> (together with any successor site(s) such as http://facebook.com/1mind4research and http://youtube.com/user/1mind4research, the "Site").</p>

<p>By providing Personally Identifiable Information to the Organization, you acknowledge that we may use and disclose such information in accordance with this Policy. If you object or do not consent to our use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Policy, please do not provide Personally Identifiable Information to the Organization or use the Site. The Organization reserves the right to revise this policy without prior notice. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "LAST UPDATED" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following such changes means that you accept the revised Policy.</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>What Types of Information Does the Organization Collect From Me?</strong> The Organization gathers three basic types of information from you: <strong>"Personally Identifiable Information" (or "PII")</strong>, <strong>"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" (or "Non-PII")</strong> and <strong>“IP Addresses.”</strong> Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non- Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. An IP Address is the Internet Protocol address of the computer that you are using.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> You do not have to provide PII to use the Site. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to sign up for a newsletter, or to view certain areas of the Site), we may require that you furnish PII. We and our service providers may collect PII from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> We and our service providers may collect Non-PII, which is information that does not personally identify you, through the Site from sources such as environmental variables (such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version), “cookies” as well as so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of our Site. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web site, to your computer. The Organization also collects Non-PII (e.g., your geographic location) when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site; such aggregated PII will be treated as Non-PII so long as it is so aggregated.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Addresses.</strong> Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically by a cookie that collects anonymous traffic data and in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s), the page(s) that you visited and how many times you visit the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>IF YOU SUBMIT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR ANY HEALTH- RELATED INFORMATION RELATING TO ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN YOURSELF TO THE ORGANIZATION, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED ANY NECESSARY NOTICES AND OBTAINED ANY NECESSARY CONSENTS.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>How Does the Organization Use Information Collected From Me?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Personally Identifiable Information. We may use PII about you in the following ways:
                
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                    <li><strong>Fulfillment of Requests.</strong> The Organization may use PII about you to respond to your requests such as to send newsletters to you or to process your donations. We may also use PII combined with health- related information about you and others to fulfill such requests, for example, if you tell us that you or a loved one have been diagnosed with a particular brain disorder,.
                    <li><strong>Receipts and Thank You Notes to Donors.</strong> The Organization may use PII about you to send automatically generated receipts and thank you notes to you if you donate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administrative Communications.</strong> From time to time, we may use PII about you to send to you important information regarding the Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies or other administrative information. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Communications.</strong> From time to time, the Organization and/or its affiliates (collectively, the “Affiliated Entities”) may use PII about you to inform you of products, programs and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not send such messages to you, please see the "Opt-Out" section below.</li>
                    <li><strong>Donations.</strong> We use a third party payment service, Authorize.Net, to process donations made through the Site. If you wish to make a donation through the Site, you will receive an email confirmation automatically generated by Authorize.Net. Any PII that you provide through the donation page on the Authorize.Net Page may be collected by Authorize.Net and by the Organization, and will be subject to Authorize.Net’s privacy policy. The Organization has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, Authorize.Net’s use of information collected through the Authorize.Net Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE Authorize.Net PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF Authorize.Net.</li>
                    <li><strong>E-mail and Private Messages to Friends.</strong> We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, you may be required to provide us with, and we may use, your friend’s e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending of such message to your friend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal Business Purposes.</strong> We may also use PII about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits and so forth.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such NonPII (which does not personally identify you) with third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-PII with PII (such as combining your name with your geographic location). If we do combine any Non- PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How Is Personally Identifiable Information Disclosed?</h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Affiliated Entities.</strong> We may share PII with the Affiliated Entities so that they may use such PII to send you information regarding products, programs and services. The Organization is the party responsible for the management of PII that is jointly used by the Organization and the Affiliated Entities. If you would prefer that we do not share your information with Affiliated Entities, please see the “Opt-Out” section below.</li>
    <li><strong>Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We work with third parties who provide services including, but not limited to, data analysis, web hosting, IT services, accounting, payment processing and other services of an administrative nature. We reserve the right to share PII about you with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide these services.</li>
    <li><strong>E-mails to Friends.</strong> Please note that any PII you provide in connection with sending messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site, such as your name and your e-mail address, will, of course, be disclosed to your friend.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Posted by Visitors.</strong> The Organization may make available through the Site services (for example forums, among other services) to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through those services or otherwise on the Site becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose PII about you, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE OF ANY PII, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION, YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE.</li>
    <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to an Affiliated Entity or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of the Organization’s business, assets or stock (including, without limitation, in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
    <li><strong>Law enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose PII about you to others as we believe to be appropriate (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to governmental requests, including requests by government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our Terms of Use; (e) to protect our operations or those of an Affiliated Entity; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of the Organization, the Affiliated Entities, you or others; and (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Other Important Notices Regarding Our Privacy Practices.</h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Note Regarding HIPAA:</strong> You understand and acknowledge that the Organization is not a covered entity within the meaning of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its related regulations set forth in Parts 160, 162, and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) and is not acting on behalf of a covered entity in its capacity as the host of the Site and that any information you submit to the Organization through or in connection with the Site that would otherwise be regarded as protected health information for purposes of HIPAA will not be subject to the limitations on the use and disclosure of such information by covered entities under HIPAA.</li>
    <li><strong>Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Children:</strong> The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site.</li>
    <li><strong>Third Party Sites.</strong> The Site may contain links to third party web sites. These linked sites are not under the Organization’s control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by the Organization or any Affiliated Entities. If you provide any PII through any third party web site, your transaction will occur on the third party's web site (not the Site) and the PII you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE AFFILIATED ENTITIES.</li>
    <li><strong>Jurisdictional Issues.</strong> The Site is controlled and operated by the Organization from the United States, and is not intended to subject the Organization to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. The Organization does not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Site's availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion.</li>
    <li><strong>Security.</strong> We seek to have within the Organization security measures and tools, such as firewalls, in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with Section 8 ("Contacting Us") below (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out.</strong> If you do not wish to receive newsletters, e-mails or information from us regarding fundraising and other programs and services, or if you would prefer that we do not share PII about you on a going-forward basis with Affiliated Entities and/or with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving such e-mails by clicking “Unsubscribe” in the footer of any email we send, or by contacting us via e-mail at info@1mind4research.org. Please specify clearly which of the following choices you are opting out of:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>Receiving newsletters, emails or other information from the Organization, or</li>
            <li>Allowing the Organization to share PII about you with the Affiliated Entities.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        <p>We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove PII about you from the databases of third parties with which we have already shared PII about you (e.g., third party service providers to whom we have already provided PII about you as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). If you wish to cease receiving e-mails from third parties, please contact the third parties directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or e-mails to you.</p>
