        <h4>Term and Termination</h4>

        <p>This Agreement is effective upon your unequivocal acceptance as set forth herein and shall continue in full force until terminated.  You agree that One Mind, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use of the Website or any part thereof upon prior notice, and remove and discard any Content, in the event you violate these Terms of Use.  You agree that One Mind may immediately suspend your account and your access to the Website or any part thereof in order to conduct an investigation in the event it believes you have violated these Terms of Use or if it determines that you are a repeat infringer of another’s intellectual property or other rights.  One Mind may also, in its sole discretion and at any time, discontinue providing the Website, any part thereof, any Content or any products or services advertised thereon, with or without notice.  In addition to any other method of termination or suspension provided for in this Agreement, One Mind reserves the right to terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason upon ten (10) days’ notice to you.

        <h4>Governing Law and Other Miscellaneous Terms</h4>

        <p>The parties and their respective personnel are and shall be independent contractors, and neither party by virtue of this Agreement shall have any right, power or authority to act or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party.</p>

        <p>You acknowledge and agree that any expenses that you incur in furtherance of this Agreement are voluntary in nature and are made with the knowledge that this Agreement may be terminated as provided herein.  You shall not make a claim against One Mind, and One Mind shall not be liable with respect to the recoupment of any expenditures or investment made by you in anticipation of the continuation of this Agreement beyond the term hereof.</p>

        <p>The parties agree that breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to One Mind which would be both difficult to ascertain and which would not be compensable by damages alone.  As such, the parties agree that One Mind has the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement by injunction (without necessity of posting bond), specific performance or other equitable relief without prejudice to any other rights and remedies One Mind may have for your breach of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>The validity and effect of these Terms of Use shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to its conflicts or choice of laws principles.  ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING CONCERNING OR RELATING TO THE WEBSITE, ITS USE, THESE TERMS OF USE, ANY SALE OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT, SERVICE, POLICY OR PROCEDURE OF ONE MIND, MUST BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON, AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT (AND OF THE APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM) IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, YOU IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH YOU MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHICH IS BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT OR IMPROPER FORUM.</p>

        <p>If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants and other professionals, and costs and expenses in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.</p>

        <p>The captions and headings of this Agreement are included for ease of reference only and will be disregarded in interpreting and construing this Agreement.</p>

        <p>If the performance of any part of this Agreement by either party (other than payment of money) is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any flood, riot, fire, judicial or governmental action, labor dispute, act of God, telecommunications failure or any other cause beyond the control of either party, that party shall be excused from such performance to the extent that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such cause.</p>

        <p>This Agreement, including any other agreements or additional terms referenced herein, constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the Agreement between the parties with respect to the Website, Content and products and services offered via the Website, and, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, it supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous communications, representations, statements and understandings, whether oral or written, between the parties concerning the Website, Content and products and services sold via the Website.  If any provision of this Agreement is found unlawful or unenforceable in any respect, the court shall reform such provision so as to render it enforceable or, if it is not possible to reform such provision so as to make it enforceable, then delete such provision.  As so reformed or modified, the court shall fully enforce this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement that by their content are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, provisions governing ownership and use of intellectual property, representations, disclaimers, warranties, liability, indemnification, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, remedies, rights after termination and interpretation of this Agreement, will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for their full statutory period.</p>

        <p>Counter-Notice.  If you believe that the User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
            <li>identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
            <li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that the User Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content; and</li>

Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the person providing such User Content, the removed User Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at One Mind’s sole discretion.</p>
