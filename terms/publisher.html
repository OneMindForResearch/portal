        <h4>(Effective: May 1, 2015)</h4>

        <p>The One Mind community portal website and any derivative website on which these Portal Publisher Terms (“Publisher Terms”) are posted are owned and operated by One Mind, Inc. (“One Mind”). One Mind has adopted these Publisher Terms to make you aware of the terms and conditions of your use of the <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">website</a> and any derivative websites on which these Publisher Terms are posted (collectively, “Website”) and any Content or other products or services that are offered or provided via the Website to post or publish User Content.  In the event that you purport to be the agent of, represent, or otherwise act on behalf of an entity or any other person, references to “you,” “your” or “User” shall include such entity or person in addition to you, and your acceptance of these Publisher Terms shall constitute acceptance on behalf of such entity or person.</p>

        <p>These Publisher Terms are in addition to all other terms, conditions and restrictions placed on use of the Website by One Mind, including without limitation the Portal Website Terms of Use located at <a href="user.html" target="_blank">https://portal.onemind.org/terms/user</a>, which are hereby expressly incorporated into these Publisher Terms.</p>

        <p>One Mind reserves the right, at its discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Publisher Terms at any time by posting such changes to this page.  In addition, if you have previously registered an account, One Mind will endeavor to notify you of such changes via the email address you provided to One Mind.  You understand that you have the affirmative obligation to check these Publisher Terms periodically for changes, and you hereby agree to periodically review these Publisher Terms for such changes.  The continued use of the Website following the posting of changes to these Publisher Terms will constitute your acceptance of those changes.  The most current version of these Publisher Terms can be reviewed at <a href="publisher.html" target="_blank">https://portal.onemind.org/terms/publisher</a>.</p>

        <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">By posting USER Content or any other information to the Website or manifesting your assent to these Publisher Terms in any other manner, you hereby UNEQUIVOCALLY AND expressly agree to, and shall be subject to, these Publisher Terms.  If you do not UNEQUIVOCALLY agree to these Publisher Terms, you may not post USER Content or any other information to the Website.</p>

        <h4>General Publisher Terms and Restrictions</h4>

        <p>One Mind hereby grants you a limited, nonexclusive, nonassignable, nontransferable license to access and use the Website subject to your agreement to, compliance with and satisfaction of these Publisher Terms.  All rights not otherwise expressly granted by these Publisher Terms are reserved by One Mind.

You further agree that such measures shall be taken in One Mind’s sole discretion and without liability to you or any third party.</p>

        <h4>User Content</h4>

        <p>Subject to compliance with these Publisher Terms, One Mind provides you the opportunity to post User Content.  “User Content” shall mean information, software, photos, video, text, graphics, music, sounds or other material provided and posted by you via the Website.</p>

        <p>User Content is the intellectual property of you and/or your licensors, if any.  One Mind does not claim any ownership rights in such User Content.  By posting User Content via the Website, however, you hereby grant to One Mind a limited, transferable, nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, edit, adapt, publish, translate, display, distribute, sell, sublicense and create derivative works and compilations incorporating such User Content in any media.</p>

        <p>When posting User Content, you as the publisher are responsible for (a) setting your desired access control restrictions upon posting; (b) subjecting the User Content to any applicable additional terms and restrictions governing Website users’ use of such User Content; (c) verification and authentication of the identity of Website users to whom you grant access rights to the User Content; and (d) ensuring that such users comply with your or your licensors’ restrictions and intellectual property rights and complies with all applicable laws and regulations.  You agree that any User Content that you post that contains any information about a third party must be de-identified prior to posting, and that any User Content that posts information about individuals’ health care is de-identified in conformance with the standards for de-identification under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) Privacy Rule at 45 Code of Federal Regulations § 164.512(b).  When posting content on the One Mind Portal you are stating that you have the appropriate releases and rights to share the data.   You understand and agree that One Mind has no control over the use or distribution of any User Content you post on the Website and no liability for use or distribution in violation of your restrictions and intellectual property rights or in violation of applicable laws.   As a result, to the extent permitted by law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold One Mind and its directors, officers, employees, and agents, harmless from and against such portion of damages, penalties, fines, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and settlement costs, as applicable (collectively “Losses”), resulting from any demand, suit, action, or proceeding brought by a third party (collectively, “Claim”) and attributable to the User Content.</p>

        <p>One Mind does not generally monitor or otherwise remove User Content after it is posted on the Website except under certain limited circumstances as required, to ensure compatibility, permitted by law or otherwise in the sole discretion of One Mind.  In the event you would like to request that One Mind remove your User Content from the Website, please contact One Mind at support@onemind.org.  Please note however, that if One Mind agrees, in its sole discretion to remove your User Content, such User Content may not be completely removed or may otherwise still be available to others in the following circumstances: (a) your User Content has been incorporated into derivative works or compilations created by One Mind or other parties; (b) such User Content has been retained in One Mind’s data backup systems or for archival purposes; or (c) to the extent such User Content has been downloaded by other persons and such persons retain your User Content.</p>

You agree to immediately notify One Mind in the event (a) your registration information changes; or (b) you learn of or have reason to suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.  You also agree that you will provide truthful and accurate information during the registration process.  One Mind may refuse to grant a particular username to you for any reason, including, without limitation, in the event One Mind determines that such username impersonates someone else, is protected by trademark or other proprietary right law or is vulgar or otherwise offensive.</p>
